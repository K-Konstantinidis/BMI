# BMI
A very simple C project to calculate your body mass index (BMI).

This is a very simple project. At 1st you insert your height. After that you insert your weight.

And the you will see your BMI followed by a message telling you if you are 
Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese.

Do not take the answer of the program seriously, if you really want to calculate your BMI you should check with a specialist.

In this project, the "genlib.h" & "simpio.h" from roberts libraries have been used.
